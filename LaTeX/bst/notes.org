Notes on what need to be added from =jpp-doi.bst= to =jpp-like.bst= in
order to create the =jpp-like-doi.bst= style file.

* Add `sortyear` to `ENTRY` list
* Try to get "~\& " (non-breaking space before ampersand)
Easiest way is to change
```
"\&"
space.word * t *
```
into
```
"~\& " * t *
```
* Add effect of sort year to `presort` and `bib.sort.order` `FUNCTION`s
** It should be looking something like:
```
  sortyear field.or.null sortify
  *
  "    "
  *
  title field.or.null
  sort.format.title
  *
  #1 entry.max$ substring$
  'sort.key$ :=
```
* Modify list of LaTeX lines of code added to the `begin.bib` `preamble$` 
** Add changes to "\bibsep" and "\bbihang"
The lines
```
  "\setlength{\bibsep}{0.5ex}"
  write$ newline$
  "\setlength{\bibhang}{5ex}"
  write$ newline$
```
should be added *before* the line with `"\begin{thebibliography}...`. 
** Change "\doi" to
"\providecommand{\doi}[1]{\textsc{doi}:~\href{http://dx.doi.org/#1}{\nolinkurl{#1}}}"
